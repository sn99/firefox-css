My Firefox ðŸ¦Š browser configuration

After each distro reset or Firefox installation, I make a few changes to improve the quality of life while keeping Firefox as vanilla as possible. These include:

- Keeping the `Close Tab` button available, even when multiple tabs are open
- Adding a line between different tabs to separate them
- Removing the space below tabs
- Adding icons to the `application menu`
- Disabling the Pocket extension
- Changing the Firefox frame rate to `120` (edit `user.js` if your screen doesn't support it)
- Changing the default processor allocation from a maximum of 8 to 12 (edit `user.js` if your processor doesn't have as many threads/cores)

## Usage

1. In the address bar, type `about:support`

   ![about:support](https://github.com/sn99/firefox-css/blob/main/_readme/about_support.png)
2. Navigate to `Profile Directory` and click on `Open Directory`

   ![about:support](https://github.com/sn99/firefox-css/blob/main/_readme/profile_directory.png)
3. Copy and paste the `chrome` folder and the edited `user.js` file into the opened directory
